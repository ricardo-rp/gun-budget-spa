# Svelte SPA template

This template uses [adapter-static](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters#supported-environments-static-sites) and the [ssr disabler hook](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters#supported-environments-static-sites) to allow us to make a SPA.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
